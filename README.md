# animals-with-react-hooks
It's just a simple project to test the new feature [Introducing_Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) proposed by Sophie Alpert(@sophiebits) and Dan Abramov(@gaearon) in React Conf 2018.

In this project I used a list of animals provided by https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ endpoint to list them all. Also, I started with the package `create-react-app` and updated the main `App.js` file to work as the new function based to maintain consistency during the sampling exercise.

Dependencies used: 
```
"dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.18.0",
    "react": "16.7.0-alpha.0",
    "react-dom": "16.7.0-alpha.0",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.2"
  }
```

Happy Coding!
